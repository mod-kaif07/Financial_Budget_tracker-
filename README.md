Financial Budget Tracker  
Technologies: Java, SQL, NetBeans, MySQL Connector

Project Overview:  
I have developed a Financial Budget Tracker application with the following features:
- Users can add expense categories and record expenses by date.
- The application allows tracking of past expenditures by both date and category.
- MySQL connector was used to ensure robust database connectivity.
- The user interface was built in NetBeans to enhance user experience.



For your convenience, I have compiled the application into an executable file (.exe) that contains all the necessary libraries and dependencies. This ensures that the application can be run easily without the need for additional installations. 
file name - SpendingTracker exe file

I've also uploaded the jar file of my application, which will be useful for you. Additionally, I have provided the schema used for database communication, where all the data is stored within these two schemas.

sql database -spedingdb



I have included three source code files, each representing a different interface I developed to enhance various functionalities of the application. These files are crucial for understanding the different aspects of the applicationâ€™s user interface and the facilities they provide
